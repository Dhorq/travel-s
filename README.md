# Travel Tour Website 🌍✈️

This project is a **pure HTML & CSS** travel tour website built with the goal of **mastering and refining front-end fundamentals**, no JavaScript, no frameworks, just raw HTML & CSS.

## 🎯 Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to:
- Strengthen my **HTML structure** and semantic markup skills
- Deepen my **CSS styling, layout, and responsive design** abilities
- Build a **visually appealing and functional** travel tour site using only core web technologies

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** – For semantic structure and content organization
- **CSS3** – For styling, layouts, animations, and responsiveness

_No additional libraries, preprocessors, or JavaScript were used._

## ✨ Features
- Responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Attractive homepage showcasing travel destinations
- Tour detail sections with images and descriptions
- Contact form layout (HTML only)
- CSS transitions and hover effects

## 📚 Skills Practiced
- Semantic HTML & accessibility best practices
- CSS Flexbox & Grid for layouts
- Responsive media queries
- Typography and color theory
- Reusable class naming & maintainable stylesheets

## 📌 Project Status
⏳ **80%** 
🚀 Future improvement ideas:
- Add JavaScript for interactivity (carousel, form validation, etc.)
- Expand content with more destinations
- Integrate booking functionality

## ⚠️ Limitations & Weaknesses
- Code Cleanliness: The HTML and CSS structure is intentionally not completely clean code because its main purpose is only for UI, some selectors are inconsistent and class naming can still be improved.
- Feature Completion: Some desired features (e.g. image carousel and form validation) were not completed because they would be more optimal using JavaScript.
- Scalability: The code is not optimized for long-term development or advanced feature integration.

**Why I Made This Project?**  
I wanted to challenge myself to **fully rely on HTML and CSS** — understanding how far core technologies can go before adding JavaScript or frameworks. This approach strengthens the foundation needed for building any website.
